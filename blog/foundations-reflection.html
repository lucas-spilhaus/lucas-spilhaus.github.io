          <h2 class="body-subheading">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h2>
          <p1 class="body-txt">
            The only thing that comes to mind is understanding how my brain and neuroplasticity works. I did learn more than just this during Human Skills, but none of that is about myself specifically and are more general concepts such as growth vs fixed mindsets or emotional intelligence. 
          </p1>
          <h2 class="body-subheading">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
          <p1 class="body-txt">
            Improve and support a good attitude towards programming, collaborative work, and learning. By understanding our self and those around us, we can more effectively improve our skills.
          </p1>
          <h2 class="body-subheading">What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h2>
          <p1 class="body-txt">
            The significance of neuroplasticity surprised me. It wasn’t something I had properly looked into or really heard about before despite its importance in learning.
          </p1>
          <h2 class="body-subheading">What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h2>
          <p1 class="body-txt">
            Honestly, simply engaging fully with many of the Human Skills tasks proved a challenge. Much of Human Skills just didn’t click with me the same way the tech aspects of Foundations did. I understood the significance and why we covered what we did, but I still struggled to find much interest in some topics.
          </p1>
          <h2 class="body-subheading">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
          <p1 class="body-txt">
            Human Skills are important in any environment, being able to understand oneself and those around you is an incredibly helpful tool. But web development specifically is very group-orientated and thus having effective human skills is necessary.
          </p1>
          <h2 class="body-subheading">Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
          <p1 class="body-txt" style="margin-bottom: 10vh;">
            No, it doesn’t feel like a waste. I might not have enjoyed it to the same extent as I did the programming aspects, but it was nonetheless still important. As for why, just look over my previous answer. Every part of Human Skills, from neuroplasticity and growth mindsets to emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and empathy, all plays a part in making us better programmers and people in general.
