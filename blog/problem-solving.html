            <p1 class="body-txt">
                During Sprint 3 there was one question I just couldn't figure out despite how simple it seemed. I went through every website I could find trying to understand just where I was going wrong and how to correct myself. It was an incredibly frustrating process as it seemed like I had done the question perfectly but I was still wrong. 
                <br><br>The issue ended up being as simple as me misunderstanding what the question was asking of me. Once I understood what was actually being asked, I wrote up my code and passed in ten seconds. This whole ordeal taught me the importance of ensuring I understand the question fully.

            <h2 class="body-subheading">A time you elegantly solved a problem</h2>
            <p1 class="body-txt">
                I'm very happy with how I handled the Sprint 4 Kata challenges overall, but I completed the FlipFlop one particularly well. I went over the question making sure I fully grasped the task at hand and then wrote pseudocode to outline how I needed my code to behave.
                By doing this I was able to write my code and have it successfully work with minimal issue or mistakes. I learned why planning is so necessary when completing a project.

            <h2 class="body-subheading">Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h2>
            <ul class="body-txt">
                <li><p1 style="font-weight: bold;">Pseudocode: </p1>Pseudocode is something I see myself using a lot due to the simplicity and that it's an oppurtunity to layout how I want my code to function.</li>
                <li><p1 style="font-weight: bold;">Trying something: </p1>Just trying stuff until something seems to stick is the best problem-solving technique without a doubt.</li>
                <li><p1 style="font-weight: bold;">Rubber ducky method: </p1>Another very simple method, but I enjoy it. Helps in understanding what my code actually does.</li>
                <li><p1 style="font-weight: bold;">Console.logging: </p1>Very useful, already use this a lot.</li>
                <li><p1 style="font-weight: bold;">Reading error messages: </p1>Something I'm not too confident with as I don't fully understand many error messages yet.</li>
                <li><p1 style="font-weight: bold;">Googling: </p1>Not much to say, Google's useful.</li>
                <li><p1 style="font-weight: bold;">Asking your peers/coaches for help: </p1>I generally stray away from asking others for assassitance in independent work like this and would much rather figures this out myself.</li>
                <li><p1 style="font-weight: bold;">Improving your process with reflection: </p1>Great for improving on my overall technique.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="body-subheading">Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h2>
            <p1 class="body-txt" style="margin-bottom: 10vh">
                During the previous Sprint 3 example asking for help would've been the simplest solution and been much less time-consuming than what I did do. I was reluctant in part as I hadn't engaged with my cohort much at that point, but also for the same reasons I talked about in the last section.
                I would like to say I'll be more willing to ask for help next time, but I realistically know that isn't true.
