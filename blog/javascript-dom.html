              <h1 class="body-heading">JavaScript Fundamentals</h1>
              <h2 class="body-subheading">An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTM and CSS</h2>
              <p class="body-txt">Think of HTML as a building of some sort, say a house or store. HTML is the layout and basic structure of the building. Now CSS comes and handles decoration and the design. CSS decides the color scheme of the building, the wallpaper, flooring, etc. Now JavaScript is the fancy stuff. JavaScript lets us control various aspects of the building, like closing curtains or turning lights off via your phone. JavaScript allows us to interact with the building how we please.</p>
              <h2 class="body-subheading">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h2>
              <p class="body-txt">Control flow is the order in which statements are carried out by a computer reading code. Think of it as building a house (again). Thereâ€™s a step-by-step process to follow to reach the desired outcome.<br><br>Loops are a repeated process which only end at a specified point. Some loops may run a set number of times, while others may run until a condition is met or no longer met.</p>

              <p class="body-txt" style="font-size:medium;">This loop would put each name within the array "names" in console</p>
              <h2 class="body-subheading">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</h2>
              <p class="body-txt">Simply put, the DOM is a representation of a websites structure. What the DOM allows us to do is interact with the page and its content using something like JavaScript. For example, you could use the DOM to change the color of a section of text.</p>
              <h2 class="body-subheading">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
              <p class="body-txt">An array contains various items under one variable name while an object contains items under keys. Accessing data from an array is as simple as the array name with the slot you want to access, however it is important to remember that arrays start at 0 rather than 1. So, to access the first slot in an array, we would use array[0].<br><br>As for accessing data from an object, we use dot notation. While slightly more complicated than arrays, dot notation is still very simple. To access data we would go nameA.nameB.nameC, similar to how we would with folders on a computer, but with periods rather than backwards slashes.</p>
              <img class="body-img" style="margin-top: 5vh;" src="imgs/array-example.png">
              <p class="body-txt" style="font-size:medium;">An array called names that stores 4 names.</p>
              <img class="body-img" style="margin-top: 5vh;" src="imgs/object-example.png">
              <p class="body-txt" style="font-size:medium;">An object called names that stores 4 names along with the age and heights connected to them.</p>
              <h2 class="body-subheading">Explain what functions are and why they are helpful</h2>
              <p class="body-txt" style="margin-bottom: 10vh;">Functions are a way to save code and call upon it later. For example, I could write a function that generated a number between 1 and 10 and then call it as many times as needed throughout my code. Functions allow us to not have to re-write the same piece of code each time we want to use it. On top of this, functions let us break our code into modules, making it easier to find and correct bugs and improving our readability.</p>
