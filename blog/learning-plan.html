              <ul class="body-txt">
                  <li><p1 style="font-weight: bold;">Persistence: </p1>I'm able to keep working at an issue until I've developed/found a solution.</li>
                  <li><p1 style="font-weight: bold;">Motivated: </p1>I really enjoy the problem-solving of coding and thus commit myself to it much more than I otherwise would.</li>
              </ul>
              <li class="body-txt" style="font-size: calc(25px + 0.5vw); font-weight: bold;">Weaknesses</li>
              <ul class="body-txt">
                  <li><p1 style="font-weight: bold;">Rarely ask for help: </p1>Generally speaking, I perfer to just keep trying on my own rather than reach out for help.</li>
                  <li><p1 style="font-weight: bold;">Procrastination: </p1>Self-explanatory, I am horrible with procrastinating.</li>
                  <li><p1 style="font-weight: bold;">Easily distracted: </p1>Ties in with procrastination, I'm very easily distracted and this is especially true when I'm not fully enjoying the current material.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="body-subheading">What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
            <p1 class="body-txt">My social skills and confidence are something I’d like to improve on. I’ve always quite enjoyed engaging with and getting to know people, but I lack the confidence to act on this. Dev Academy makes a big deal out of getting to know your cohort during your course, so I see this as somewhat of an opportunity to improve those aspects of myself. </p1>
            <h1 class="body-subheading">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h1>
            <p1 class="body-txt">I will ensure that I commit myself to finishing this course and keeping up with my study plans. I believe mutual respect and understanding towards one another is incredibly important and will thus base myself on this during my time at Dev Academy. If I eventually am overwhelmed with the workload, I'll take a break and focus on something else to destress. If I reach a point where I cannot handle myself fully, I will reach out to others for support, be it facilitators or my own support network. </p1>
            <h1 class="body-subheading">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>
            <p1 class="body-txt">I’ll rely on researching my issue and if unable to deal with it through that, go to the Discord and ask for help via the appropriate channels.</p1>
            <h1 class="body-subheading">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h1>
            <p1 class="body-txt">Regular check-ins/communication and the availability to reach out for help over specific topics. While I haven’t been doing this course for long, I’ve seen the Facilitation team carry out both with other members of my cohort and myself, albeit to a smaller extent.</p1>
            <h1 class="body-subheading">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. </h1>
            <p1 class="body-txt">I currently have no other major commitments outside of this course.</p1>

            <h1 class="body-heading">My Learning Plan: Part 2</h1>
            <h2 class="body-subheading">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
            <p1 class="body-txt">
              Still would like to develop skills as a developer and get a step into the industry.
            </p1>
            <h2 class="body-subheading">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
            <p1 class="body-txt">
              Getting used to the new enviroment. I've been enjoying the online aspect of Foundations so switching to Bootcamps more in-person learning will be interesting.
            </p1>
            <h2 class="body-subheading">What non-technical skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
            <p1 class="body-txt">
              Still want to improve social skills and overall confidence.
            </p1>
            <h2 class="body-subheading">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
            <p1 class="body-txt">
              Pretty much the exact same as foundations, just regular check-ins and the oppurtunity to recieve support through Bootcamp.
            </p1>
            <h2 class="body-subheading">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
            <p1 class="body-txt"  style="margin-bottom: 10vh;">
              I'll likely use the same methods as Foundations when it comes to seeking help, the Discord, Googling, or contacting facilitators directly.
              <br><br>
              I will manage the workload by ensuring I complete a set amount of work each day and meet provided deadlines. If I am in a position where I am unable to progress, I will seek help using the methods listed above. 
              As I did during Foundations, I will commit myself to respecting my cohort and the facilitators during my time during Bootcamp.
