          <h1 class="body-heading">My Identity and Values</h1>
          <h2 class="body-subheading">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now</h2>
          <p1 class="body-txt">Back in my twelfth year of Highschool, I, in my infinite wisdom as a 16-year-old, decided to steal a history test. I expected my teacher to catch me in the act and it would all be a big joke, I never intended to actually steal it, but I somehow managed.<br><br>Once the day was over, I was hit with the dilemma of this situation.  In my mind, I could either read the questions and cheat or dispose of the test. On one hand, getting a guaranteed 90% would be pretty nice, but on the other, did I really want to go against my teacher’s trust more than I already had? Ultimately, I ended up disposing of the test without viewing or showing anyone else and informing my teacher of what had happened.<br><br>Looking back on this now, I believe I was an idiot, an incredibly lucky idiot. I had betrayed my teacher's trust by doing what I did, but I think I made the correct choice by not only not cheating but also coming clean with him. </p1>
          <h2 class="body-subheading">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity</h1>
          <p1 class="body-txt">My family is a large part of why I consider humor a very important part of my life. That and my love of gaming and computers in general can be attributed to my family.</p1>
          <h2 class="body-subheading">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey</h1>
          <p1 class="body-txt">One large strength I believe I have is my ability to work in a team environment. I enjoy being able to rely on others while simultaneously offering support to them. This course and the industry as a whole seems to have a large focus on group work where this will be useful.</p1>
          <h2 class="body-subheading">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h1>
          <p1 class="body-txt">A major limitation is that I get off topic and procrastinate far too much. Given that my workstation is also where I spend the majority of my free time, it’s easy to find things to take my attention away from the primary task as hand. I’d expect this to be an issue during my time at Dev Academy as a large chunk of the course is entirely self-taught learning and thus means I’ll be entirely self-governing and likely end up giving into distractions while studying.</p1>
          <h2 class="body-subheading">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why</h2>
          <p1 class="body-txt" style="margin-bottom: 10vh;">In all honesty, the only example that comes to mind is while playing Minecraft, a popular sandbox game I’m sure you’ve heard of, with mates. At the time we were planning a project together which would take us a couple months to plan and eventually put together. The primary issue which arose was conflict while designing and building the product. As one expects with a large group of people all collaborating, everyone wants something different, and concessions must be made. The solution we came to was we all tried to choose designs based on objective criteria rather than whatever we thought was coolest or whatnot.<br><br>This worked reasonably well, but it wasn’t a perfect solution. Looking back at it now, there’s nothing I would change about how we handled the situation. Everything was resolved without too much further conflict and the project was somewhat completed. </p1>
